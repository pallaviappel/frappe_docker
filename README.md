# Getting Started

To get started you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) setup on your machine. For Docker basics and best practices refer to Docker's [documentation](http://docs.docker.com).

Once completed, chose one of the following two sections for next steps.

### Try on your Dev environment

First clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pallaviappel/frappe_docker
cd frappe_docker
```

Then run: `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d`

## Final steps

Wait for 5 minutes for ERPNext site to be created or check `create-site` container logs before opening browser on port 8080. (username: `Administrator`, password: `admin`)

If you ran in a Dev Docker environment, to view container logs: `docker compose -f pwd.yml -d`. Don't worry about some of the initial error messages, some services take a while to become ready, and then they go away.
